If the sequence of items is important (e.g., a list of steps in a recipe or a history of user actions), then lists are the appropriate choice.\n",
        "  *  **Index-based access is common:** When elements are frequently accessed by their position within the collection (e.g., retrieving the third element in a list), lists offer efficient, direct access through indexing, with O(1) time complexity.\n",
        "  *  **Sequential processing is needed:** Tasks that involve iterating through elements in a specific order, like processing a queue or sorting data, are well-suited for lists.\n",
        "  *  **Duplicates are allowed and necessary:** Lists permit duplicate elements, as each element has a unique index, enabling the storage of multiple identical values if needed.\n",
